     * Previously height of the box was controlled with paddingTop/paddingBottom trick inside Wrapper.
     * It allowed height to be defined by a given percent ratio and so absolute value was defined by actual width.
     * Also, it was part of styled component, which was fine because it was static through out life time of component.
     *
     * Now, two things changed:
     * 1. If `height` is present we take it as actual height of the box, and hence we don't need
     * (or even can't have, due to lack of width value) paddingTop trick.
     * 2. Since `height` can be changing through out life time of a component, we can't have it as part of styled component,
     * and hence we use `style` prop.
