 * Async helper determining if we should fetch remote fileStates from the backend:
 * - we poll the backend for all supported documents,
 * - we poll the backend is mimeType isn't natively supported by the browser,
 * - we poll the backend if we don't have a local preview available.
 * - we poll the backend if we have a video with which we can't extract dimensions,
 *
 * Polling the backend periodically refreshes the cached fileState until the file is processed.
 * Polling is needed for the use cases above to properly render the file in our components.
