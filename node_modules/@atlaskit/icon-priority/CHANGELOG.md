# @atlaskit/icon-priority

## 6.3.3

### Patch Changes

- [`8e735385d47`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/8e735385d47) - Adds deprecation warning to package to reflect deprecated status.

## 6.3.2

### Patch Changes

- [`f0be7593aa3`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/f0be7593aa3) - Internal code change turning on new linting rules.

## 6.3.1

### Patch Changes

- [`b3e5a62a9e3`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/b3e5a62a9e3) - Adds `static` techstack to package, enforcing stricter style linting. In this case the package already satisfied this requirement so there have been no changes to styles.

## 6.3.0

### Minor Changes

- [`93d6f8856f2`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/93d6f8856f2) - @atlaskit/icon-priority has been deprecated due to low usage. It will be deleted after 9 May 2022. If you rely on these icons, @atlaskit/icon-priority will still be available as a deprecated package on NPM, but we recommend self-hosting and managing.

## 6.2.5

### Patch Changes

- [`378d1cef00f`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/378d1cef00f) - Bump `@atlaskit/theme` to version `^11.3.0`.

## 6.2.4

### Patch Changes

- [`df2bb5891ef`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/df2bb5891ef) - Use named export of base icon in all icon-\* glyphs

## 6.2.3

### Patch Changes

- [`72ef8bafec9`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/72ef8bafec9) - Add "./glyph" entry point.

## 6.2.2

### Patch Changes

- [`877e9e0b9f6`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/877e9e0b9f6) - Icon package dependency now uses carat range.

## 6.2.1

### Patch Changes

- [`469f36d9629`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/469f36d9629) - Icon build tooling has been updated.
- [`3de10e7652e`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/3de10e7652e) - Documentation updates and fixes to types for all icon packages.
- [`d98f1bb1169`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/d98f1bb1169) - Local build tooling improvements.
- [`3f36b048938`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/3f36b048938) - The color props have been removed from the TypeScript type definitions. The behavior has never worked with the glyphs but was included in the type definitions incorrectly.
- Updated dependencies

## 6.2.0

### Minor Changes

- [`d7a5826fd09`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/d7a5826fd09) - Icon priority now utilises the base icon from `@atlaskit/icon`.
- [`6a64d27e250`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/6a64d27e250) - Icon priority now ships with cjs, esm, and es2019 bundles for for exported components and utils. Glyphs unfortunately aren't included and still only export cjs bundles.

### Patch Changes

- [`79c23df6340`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/79c23df6340) - Use injected package name and version for analytics instead of version.json.
- [`f922302ad53`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/f922302ad53) - Icons no longer ship with the `focusable` attribute in their glyph exports. This attribute was only required for IE11 support. This is purely a build change and has no effect on user API.
- Updated dependencies

## 6.1.4

### Patch Changes

- [`0741b1556f6`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/0741b1556f6) - All icon glpyhs are now built without inline extends helpers, reducing their bundlesize.
- [`8d6c79b9055`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/8d6c79b9055) - Typedefs of glyphs have been updated to reflect an API change that occured in version 15. For context, `onClick` was removed as a functional prop but it was still supported by the types. This may have resulted in a confusing developer experience although the fundamental behaviour has been consistent since version 15.

## 6.1.3

### Patch Changes

- [`b9f0d16300`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/b9f0d16300) - Re-generated icons using a newer version of the build process

## 6.1.2

### Patch Changes

- [`c65f28c058`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/c65f28c058) - Change codemod to return raw source if it is not transforming a file.

  Otherwise it would run prettier which can lead to some invalid syntax outputted
  in edge cases. This is likely due to an issue in either `codemod-cli` or `jscodeshift`.

## 6.1.1

### Patch Changes

- [`8990bf36a9`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/8990bf36a9) - Add a missing codemod for the entrypoint change in 6.1.0

  To run the codemod: **You first need to have the latest version installed before you can run the codemod**

  `yarn upgrade @atlaskit/PACKAGE@^VERSION`

  Once upgraded, use the Atlaskit codemod-cli;

  `npx @atlaskit/codemod-cli --parser [PARSER] --extensions [FILE_EXTENSIONS] [TARGET_PATH]`

  Or run `npx @atlaskit/codemod-cli -h` for more details on usage.
  For Atlassians, refer to [this doc](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/framework/atlassian-frontend/codemods/01-atlassian-codemods/) for more details on the codemod CLI.

## 6.1.0

### Minor Changes

- [`6c525a8229`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/6c525a8229) - Upgraded to TypeScript 3.9.6 and tslib to 2.0.0

  to prevent duplicates of tslib being bundled.
