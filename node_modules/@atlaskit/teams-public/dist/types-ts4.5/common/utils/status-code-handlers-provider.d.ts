/**
 * Our REST clients are initialised when their module loads which makes it tricky for them to consume the `statusCodeHandlers` prop passed to App from the host application.
 * This is a temporary measure to enable the clients to consume `statusCodeHandlers`.
 * The long term solution is to replace our REST clients with Apollo client custom resolvers
 * This will unify all remote data handling under the apollo-client module which is able to easily receive `statusCodeHandlers` as it is initialised within the React portion of our app.
