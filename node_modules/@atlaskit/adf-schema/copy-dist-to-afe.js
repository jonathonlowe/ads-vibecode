/**
 * This script is used to copy the ADF Schema DIST to the AFE node_modules folder
 * so that we can test AFE with the latest ADF Schema changes.
 *
 * This script is not used in CI, it is only used by developers to test AFE with the latest ADF Schema changes.
 *
 * Start AFE server with `yarn start <package-name>` in a seperate terminal.
 *
 * To run this script, cd into adf-schema/packages/adf-schema and provide the path to the AFE node_modules folder
 * as the first argument. For example: yarn link:afe '/Users/user/atlassian-frontend/node_modules/@atlaskit/adf-schema/dist'.
 *
 * Hot reloading is not supported, so you will need to rerun this script every time you make a change to the ADF Schema that
 * you want to test in AFE.
 *
 * Do a fresh yarn install in AFE to clear the node_modules changes made by this script when finished.
